# Hello-World
I think I'm in over  my  head  
All this coding,  and building apps, and complexity really intrigued me.
Yet the more I discover,  the more I realize just how much I need to  learn.
Should be a fun learning experience. 
It's not the  destination I'm worried about,  its all the stuff in the middle.
