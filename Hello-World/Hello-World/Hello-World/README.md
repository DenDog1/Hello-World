# Hello-World
I think I'm in over  my  head  
All this coding,  and building apps, and complexity really intrigued me.
Yet the more I discover,  the more I realize just how much I need to  learn.
This is exactly why I am creating this repo. As a beginner in this 
strange/complex/over-whelming/way-to-much-shit-to-try-remeber world 
I found it extremly hard and time consuming to search the entire web for 
specific Linux commands or look up documentation for this or for that.
So I decided to create and organize a repo that is FREE for everyne to access
and do as they will. I call it the Develepors PLayground!!!
This will be an on going project where I will be constantly adding new information
about this and adding guides to that. So come on in, look around, download me,
copy me, share me, and please please please leave comments and suggestions,
and things that I should add or something that looks incorrect.
Thanks A-Million Guys!!!!
